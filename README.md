# threejs_vr_dev_box
A boilerplate project with hot swapping for testing things on Three.js

## How to use
You need to install `budo` as a global package or even better use your favourite distribution package system to install it.

`npm -g install budo`

Then run the dev server with:

`npm run dev`

In case you are using `ingnore-scripts=true` in your `.npmrc` (as you should, scripts can be used as an attack vector), use the `dev.sh` bash script.
